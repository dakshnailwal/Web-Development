                    I am a Computer Science Engineering student with a curious mind and a drive to explore beyond
                    academics. While I enjoy programming and problem-solving, my interests also include content
                    creation, finance, and understanding how things work. I believe in blending technical knowledge with
                    real-world skills to create meaningful outcomes.

                    During school, I balanced my academics with side projects like managing social media growth for
                    multiple accounts, which not only broadened my perspective but also taught me time management and
                    practical skills. I've also developed a habit of investing early to build financial discipline and
                    lifelong habits.

                    I value continuous learning, and a well-rounded approach to personal and professional growth. My
                    journey is guided by curiosity, initiative, and a passion for making the most of every opportunity.
